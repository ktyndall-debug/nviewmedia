## üé® Customize Success Page (Optional)

Right now, after submission, users see Web3Forms' success page. To use your own:

1. Create a file called `thank-you.html` in your project
2. In `index.html`, find line 381
3. Change the redirect URL from `https://web3forms.com/success` to `thank-you.html`

Example thank-you.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Thank You - NView Media</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="hero" style="min-height: 100vh; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
            <h1 style="color: #ff4500;">Thank You!</h1>
            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">We've received your message and will get back to you within 24 hours.</p>
            <a href="index.html" class="btn btn-primary" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Back to Home</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
